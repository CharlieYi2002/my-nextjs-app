I made this originally with some inspiration of a past project (boardgame buddies) which also used cards. I wanted to make the job listing card with 
important information first (company, location, title) and then as you hover, there will be an animation and on click would expand to show more details.
The save button was an image I found on Google similar to the save buttons on platforms such as Instagram. After having an inital idea in mind, I designed the 
basic format of the page on Figma and used that as inspiration as I added more.  I then wrote my initial code in codesandbox since I find it easier to install libraries if I need to and I don't like to installing things I'm not sure will stay in my 
code on my computer. 

I ran into a couple issues throughout my development. The first of which was the save button. I had issues where the save state wouldn't be unique and you could
save the same job multiple times. Additionally, the save icon had a border and I wasn't sure how to remove it. I fixed the first issue but I couldn't figure out
why the image was still rendering the border. I tried various images with different formats (jpeg & png). 

Another issue I encountered was with my location filtering. When I tested it, I tried typing CA and Chicago was filtered in since CA is a substring of Chicago. I had to
write some logic so that it would only read with starts with rather than contains. 

Additionally, after finishing, I realized my search bar only searches for job title & company but at that point, I had already created the skill filter and the location filter.
If I were to redo this, I would make the search bar search for anything and then the filtering not be specific to location or skill but rather you could input anything and 
it would filter through the entire job card.
